# Nordic Shortfall Calculator
This is a RShiny app built around calculating the absolute and proportional shortfall in QALYs for Nordics. In addition some other useful utilities are also present like cummulative survival graphs. It is currently under construction but works with dummy data and settings.

Inspired from the QALY Shortfall Calculator (https://shiny.york.ac.uk/shortfall/)
